        <h3 class="time">Mon August 20 7:32 PM -- Junk Food Junkie</h3>
        <p class='paragraph'>I confess: I am the worst junk food junkie in this great gluttonous galaxy of sugar, salt, and fat. You can keep your lentils, granola, and prunes. I want calories and carbohydrates, burgers and fries. Within minutes after waking
          up grouchy and puffy eyed in the morning, I stumble to the kitchen and pour myself a tall glass of ice cold Pepsi. Ahh! My tongue tingles and my eyes pop open. I then have the energy to eat. I rummage through the refrigerator, push aside the yogurt
          and apples, and there it is: a slice of congealed pepperoni pizza. That's enough to get me off to school and through my first class. Of course, I then head to the store on my first break for a Snickers bar and a Diet Mountain Dew. The "lite" soft
          drink, you see, compensates for the calories in the candy. An hour or two later, for lunch, I gobble down a row of Golden Double Stuf Oreos and a peanut butter sandwich, all sloshed down with a pint of chocolate milk. Later in the afternoon I stop at
          Five Guys to devour a double bacon cheeseburger and a monster order of sodium-loaded fries. Finally, before going to bed, I knock off a bag of Philly Cheese Steak Rippled Potato Chips--dripping with onion dip.</p>

        <h3 class="time">Fri August 17 8:06 PM -- The construction of global warming</h3>
        <p class='paragraph'>Climate warming, whatever one concludes about its effect on the earth, is insufficiently understood as a concept that has been constructed by scientists, politicians and others, argues David Demerrit, a lecturer in geography at
          King's College London, in an exchange with Stephen H. Schneider, a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University. Many observers consider the phenomenon's construction -- as "a global-scale environmental problem caused by the universal
          physical properties of greenhouse gases" -- to be reductionist, Mr. Demerrit writes. Yet "this reductionist formulation serves a variety of political purposes," including obscuring the role of rich nations in producing the vast majority of the
          greenhouse gases. Mr. Demerrit says his objective is to unmask the ways that scientific judgments "have both reinforced and been reinforced by certain political considerations about managing" global warming. Scientific uncertainty, he suggests, is
          emphasized in a way that reinforces dependence on experts. He is skeptical of efforts to increase public technical knowledge of the phenomenon, and instead urges efforts "to increase public understanding of and therefore trust in the social process
          through which the facts are scientifically determined." In response, Mr. Schneider agrees that "the conclusion that science is at least partially socially constructed, even if still news to some scientists, is clearly established." He bluntly states,
          however, that if scholars in the social studies of science are to be heard by more scientists, they will have to "be careful to back up all social theoretical assertions with large numbers of broadly representative empirical examples." Mr. Schneider
          also questions Mr. Demerrit's claim that scientists are motivated by politics to conceive of climate warming as a global problem rather than one created primarily by rich nations: "Most scientists are woefully unaware of the social context of the
          implications of their work and are too naive to be politically conspiratorial." He says: "What needs to be done is to go beyond platitudes about values embedded in science and to show explicitly, via many detailed and representative empirical
          examples, precisely how those social factors affected the outcome, and how it might have been otherwise if the process were differently constructed."</p>

        <h3 class="time">Fri August 17 8:06 PM -- New ways to look at the debate over globalization</h3>
        <p class='paragraph'>Articles in the two magazines offer new ways to examine the debate over globalization. In "The American Prospect," Benjamin R. Barber writes that discussions about globalization have focused on businesses and governments --
          excluding the role of citizen-led groups. Mr. Barber, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, cites numerous examples in which citizens have reshaped public debate worldwide, including the campaign against land mines, efforts to
          protect dolphins from the tuna industry, and the "microcredit" movement in which small loans are made to women in developing nations to help them start businesses. Such movements, Mr. Barber writes, are having a tremendous, positive impact, and
          deserve attention and support. At the same time, he cautions against overstating their import. "These transnational civic projects should not fool us into thinking that Amnesty International or Medecins are the equivalent in clout of AOL Time Warner"
          or the International Monetary Fund, he writes. In "Foreign Policy" meanwhile, Robert Wright, a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, asks whether globalization, in addition to creating wealth, is also creating happiness. Of course, he
          writes, Nike stockholders want their company to profit and the workers in Nike factories in developing nations want to put food on their tables. But "are those Nike stockholders really happier behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. than they
          would be driving a Hyundai Accent? Might some Indonesian factory workers be better off if they had never left the farm?" Mr. Wright asks. He cites evidence that globalization has indeed made people happier, both in some economically wealthy nations
          and some poor nations. In poor countries, he argues, greater economic wealth is not a zero-sum game because people "are attaining things -- decent nutrition, health care -- that raise their happiness level without reducing anyone else's." At the same
          time, Mr. Wright argues that a utilitarian approach to globalization might well slow it down a little while not trying to stop it or to seriously stall it -- goals that he suggests are "beyond our mortal capacity."</p>
