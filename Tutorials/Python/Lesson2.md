# Input Function

### Now that you are familiar with printing function, you can use `input()` function to get user input.

## Example

### The console asks your name

#### `Name:   `

### I write my name - Charan

#### `Name: Charan`

### When I click enter, it is going to greet me!

#### `Hello Charan`

## Code:

```python

name = input("Name:")
print("Hello" + name)
```
